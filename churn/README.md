# Customer Churn Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts customer churn in banking services using three different models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in banking services by analyzing customer behavior and financial data. The model helps identify customers who are likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Multiple model implementation and comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance visualization
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- XGBoost

## Model Performance

The project implements three different models to predict customer churn:

1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. XGBoost Classifier

Each model's performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance Analysis

## Dataset

The project uses the "Churn_Modelling.csv" dataset. Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from:
